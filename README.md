# Sorting-visualizer-
Here we have made a sorting visualizer in which user can enter any unsorted array and recieve the  sorted array in the form of some animation . Sorting methods we have used here are selection sort ,  bubble sort and insertion sort .
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements i.e. in ascending or in descending order![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117911356/204750988-1bc65933-8f37-4356-aa6d-99ce3b7129ff.png)
